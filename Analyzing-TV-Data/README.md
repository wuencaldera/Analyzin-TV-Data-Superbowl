# Project: Analyzing TV Data
### Data manipulation and visualization to explore one television broadcast dataset: The Super Bowl

With Intermediate Python under my belt, I analyzed and extracted meaningful insights from various sources.
For this set of projects, I used a combination of data manipulation and visualization to explore television data.

In this project, I looked at Super Bowl Data, generated insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows.
