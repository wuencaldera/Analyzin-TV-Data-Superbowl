# DataCamp-Projects

Projects part of the Data Scientist Career Track from Data Camp.

Ideal to build the confidence to code on my own.
Projects let me apply my skills, solving real-world problems using tools like Jupyter Notebook and complete a data analysis from start to finishâ€”all in a risk-free environment.
